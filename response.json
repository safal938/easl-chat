His ALT is 820 U/L (20.5x ULN), AST is 750 U/L (18.75xULN), and Total Bilirubin is 4.5 mg/dL (3.75x ULN). The INR of 1.3 is slightly elevated but remains below the critical threshold of ≥ 1.5, which would indicate significant coagulopathy and impending liver failure. The albumin of 3.8 g/dL is within normal limits, suggesting preserved synthetic function at this stage. The presence of jaundice and significantly elevated transaminases places him in a high-risk category for severe outcomes, as highlighted by Hy's law, which notes that hepatocellular damage with jaundice carries a mortality/liver transplant rate exceeding 10%.</PATIENT_CONTEXT>\n\n<DIVERGENT>\n    **Strategic thinking statement:** The clinical intent is to manage severe immune-mediated hepatotoxicity in a patient on immunotherapy. Key patient anchors are the significantly elevated ALT/AST and Total Bilirubin, along with the ongoing immunotherapy. The approach will involveidentifying the severity grade of the liver injury according to EASL guidelines and then outlining the recommended management steps, including drug discontinuation and potential immunosuppression.\n\n    The EASL guidelines provide a clear grading system for immune-mediated liver injury and corresponding management strategies.\n    *   **Grading of Liver Injury:** The patient's ALT (20.5 x ULN), AST (18.75 x ULN), and TBL (3.75 x ULN) place him squarely in **Grade 3 or 4** according to EASL criteria. Specifically, Grade 3 is defined as ALT/AST 5–20× ULN and TBL 3–10 × ULN, while Grade 4 is >20 × ULN for ALT/AST and >10 × ULN for TBL [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-MediatedLiver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. Given ALT is 20.5x ULN, this patient is at the cusp of Grade 4, but definitively at least Grade 3. The presence of jaundice (TBL >2ULN) in conjunction with elevated aminotransferases is a critical indicator of severe hepatotoxicity and a higher risk of severe outcome [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Prognosis and Natural History: Grading Severity, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n    *   **Immediate Management for Grade 3/4:** The EASL guidelines recommend immediate discontinuation of immunotherapy and daily monitoring of liver parameters and INR [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. Hospital admission is advised if there is biochemical evidence of impending liver failure (TBL ≥2.5 mg/dl and/or INR ≥1.5) [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. The patient's TBL is 4.5 mg/dL, which meets this criterion for hospitalization.\n    *   **Immunosuppression:** Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone or equivalent) at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day should be started [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. If there is no response within 2–3 days, mycophenolate mofetil should be added [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1,https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n    *   **Exclusion of Alternative Causes:** The guidelines emphasize ruling out other causes of liver damage, including viral infections (HAV, HBV, HCV, HEV, EBV, CMV), biliary obstruction, alcohol-related liverdisease, and autoimmune hepatitis, especially given the patient's lack of prior liver disease [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Laboratory Workup for Excluding Alternative Causes, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n    *   **Uncertainties/Missing Data:** While the patient's presentation strongly suggests irDILI, a liver biopsy is recommended in Grade 3/4 cases to exclude metastatic progression and assess the pattern and severity of damage, especially if there is no response to initial treatment or if the clinical picture is atypical [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines:Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. The specific immunotherapy agent (e.g., CTLA-4 vs. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) is not provided, which could influence the expected severity and histological pattern, though the general management principles remain similar for severe cases.\n</DIVERGENT>\n\n<LOCAL_DIVERGENT>\n    **Strategic thinking statement:** The clinical intent is to manage severe immune-mediated hepatotoxicity in a patient on immunotherapy,incorporating local institutional guidelines. Key patient anchors are the significantly elevated ALT/AST and Total Bilirubin, along with the ongoing immunotherapy. The approach will involve identifying the severity grade of the liver injury according to local guidelines and then outlining the recommended management steps, including drug discontinuation and potential immunosuppression, noting any specific local nuances.\n\n    Thelocal guidelines present two tables for managing checkpoint inhibitor-associated hepatotoxicity, with slightly different grading and management approaches.\n\n    **Local Guideline Table 1: \"Consensus Guideline for Managing Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hepatotoxicity\"**\n    *   **Grading:** This table defines **Severe (Grade 3)** asALT >10 × ULN OR TBL >3 × ULN. The patient's ALT (20.5x ULN) and TBL (3.75x ULN) both meet the criteria for Grade 3. **Fulminant (Grade 4)** is defined as severeliver injury (as per Grade 3) AND INR >1.5 with signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's INR is 1.3 and he has no asterixis, so he does not meet Grade 4 criteria by this table [cite: Consensus Guideline for Managing Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hepatotoxicity, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf].\n    *   **Immediate Management for Grade 3:** This guideline recommends immediately suspending immunotherapy and monitoring LFTs and INR every 48-72 hours. Hospitalization is recommended *only if* INR > 1.5 or signs of hepatic encephalopathy are present. Corticosteroids are *not* recommended as first-line therapy, but rather if no spontaneous improvement in LFTs after 5-7 days or if TBL continues to rise [cite: Consensus Guideline for ManagingCheckpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hepatotoxicity, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf]. This is a significant divergence from EASL.\n    *   **For Fulminant (Grade 4):** Permanently discontinue immunotherapy, urgent hospitaladmission, and immediately initiate high-dose intravenous corticosteroids [cite: Consensus Guideline for Managing Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hepatotoxicity, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf].\n\n    **Local Guideline Table 2: \"Tumor Response-Oriented Managementof Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs)\"**\n    *   **Grading:** This table defines **Severe (Grade 3)** as ALT >8x to 20x ULN OR ALT >3x ULN with Total Bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL OR Any ALT elevation withsymptoms (fatigue, jaundice, nausea). The patient's ALT (20.5x ULN) exceeds 20x ULN, and he has TBL >2.0 mg/dL with symptoms (fatigue, jaundice). This places him in the **Life-Threatening (Grade4)** category, defined as ALT >20x ULN OR Evidence of liver failure (e.g., INR >1.5, encephalopathy) [cite: Tumor Response-Oriented Management of Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs), p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf].\n    *   **Immediate Management for Life-Threatening (Grade 4):** This guideline recommends permanently discontinuing ICI therapy, admitting the patient to the hospital for immediate management, starting high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day),and obtaining urgent hepatology consultation [cite: Tumor Response-Oriented Management of Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs), p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf]. This aligns more closely with EASL for severe cases.\n\n    **LocalGuideline Text: \"Early Intervention Strategies for Immune-Mediated Hepatitis\" and \"Steroid-Sparing Approaches in Immune-Mediated Liver Injury\"**\n    *   These sections discuss proactive management for Grade 2 hepatotoxicity, including low-dose prednisone or UDCA, and are not directly applicable to thispatient's severe presentation (Grade 3/4).\n    *   **Uncertainties/Missing Data:** The local guidelines present conflicting advice regarding the threshold for hospitalization and immediate corticosteroid use for severe cases, depending on which table is referenced. The first table suggests hospitalization *only if* INR >1.5or encephalopathy, and delays steroids, while the second table (Tumor Response-Oriented) recommends immediate hospitalization and high-dose steroids for Grade 4 (which the patient meets by its criteria). This highlights a need for careful interpretation and potentially multidisciplinary discussion.\n</LOCAL_DIVERGENT>\n\n<CONVERGENT>\n    The clinical intent is to establish the immediate management strategy for severe immune-mediated hepatotoxicity.\n\n    Based on the patient's lab values (ALT 20.5x ULN, AST 18.75x ULN, TBL 3.75x ULN), thepatient presents with severe liver injury. The EASL guidelines classify this as at least Grade 3, and potentially Grade 4 given the ALT exceeding 20x ULN [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. The presence of jaundice (TBL >2.5 mg/dL) is a critical factor, indicating a higher risk of severe outcome and necessitating hospitalization [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n\n    The primary management steps supported by EASL are:\n    *   **Discontinuation of Immunotherapy:** The immunotherapy must be immediately discontinued. This is a crucialfirst step in managing immune-mediated DILI [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n    *   **Hospital Admission:** Given the TBL of 4.5 mg/dL (which is >2.5 mg/dL), hospital admission is indicated for close monitoring of liver parameters and INR daily [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n    *   **Initiation of Corticosteroids:** For Grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity, corticosteroids (methylprednisolone or equivalent) at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day shouldbe initiated [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n    *   **Exclusion of Alternative Causes:** Whileinitiating treatment, a workup to exclude other causes of liver injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction) should be performed [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Laboratory Workup for Excluding Alternative Causes, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n\n    **Comparative weighing:** The patient's clinical picture (severe transaminitis with jaundice) aligns with the criteria for immediate and aggressive management according to EASL. The INR of 1.3, while slightly elevated, is not yet in the range of overt coagulopathy (≥1.5), but the high bilirubin and transaminases warrant urgent intervention to prevent progression to liver failure. The absence of ascites or asterixis is a positive sign, but the risk of rapid deterioration is high.\n\n    **Conditional pathways:**\n    *   If no response to corticosteroids within 2–3 days, mycophenolate mofetil should be added [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n    *   Consider liverbiopsy if no response to treatment or to exclude metastatic progression [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n\n    **Synthesis & Recommendation:** The most appropriate immediate management strategy, according to EASL guidelines, is to immediately discontinue immunotherapy, admit the patient to the hospital for daily monitoring of liver function and INR, and initiate high-dose corticosteroids (1-2 mg/kg/day). A workup to exclude alternative causes of liver injury should also be performedconcurrently.\n</CONVERGENT>\n\n<LOCAL_CONVERGENT>\n    The clinical intent is to establish the immediate management strategy for severe immune-mediated hepatotoxicity, guided by local institutional guidelines.\n\n    The local guidelines present two distinct grading systems and management approaches for severe hepatotoxicity.\n    *   **LocalGuideline Table 1 (\"Consensus Guideline for Managing Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hepatotoxicity\"):** This table classifies the patient as **Severe (Grade 3)** due to ALT >10x ULN (20.5x ULN) and TBL >3x ULN (3.75x ULN) [cite: Consensus Guideline for Managing Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hepatotoxicity, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf]. For Grade 3, it recommends immediately suspending immunotherapy and monitoring LFTs/INR every 48-72 hours. However, it states that hospitalization is *only* recommended if INR >1.5 or signs of hepatic encephalopathy are present, and corticosteroids are *not* recommended as first-line, but rather after 5-7 days of observation if no improvement or TBL continues to rise [cite: Consensus Guidelinefor Managing Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hepatotoxicity, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf]. This approach is less aggressive regarding immediate hospitalization and steroid use compared to EASL.\n    *   **Local Guideline Table 2 (\"TumorResponse-Oriented Management of Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs)\"):** This table classifies the patient as **Life-Threatening (Grade 4)** because his ALT >20x ULN (20.5x ULN) and he has symptoms (fatigue, jaundice) with TBL >2.0 mg/dL [cite: Tumor Response-Oriented Management of Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs), p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf]. For Grade 4, it recommends permanently discontinuing ICI therapy, admitting the patient to thehospital for immediate management, starting high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day), and obtaining urgent hepatology consultation [cite: Tumor Response-Oriented Management of Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs), p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf]. This approach aligns more closely with the EASL recommendations for severe hepatotoxicity.\n\n    **Comparative weighing:** There is a clear divergence between the two local guideline tables regarding the immediate management of severe hepatotoxicity. The first table's recommendation to delay hospitalization and corticosteroids for Grade 3,despite significant jaundice, appears less cautious than the second table's approach for Grade 4, which the patient's labs and symptoms actually meet. Given the patient's symptomatic presentation (fatigue, dark urine, jaundice) and very high transaminases with elevated bilirubin, the more aggressive approach outlined in the \"TumorResponse-Oriented Management\" table (Grade 4) seems more appropriate and safer. The other local guideline sections on \"Early Intervention Strategies\" and \"Steroid-Sparing Approaches\" are not applicable as they pertain to Grade 2 hepatotoxicity.\n\n    **Conditional pathways:**\n    *   If the patient's conditiondeteriorates (e.g., INR >1.5, encephalopathy), urgent admission to a center with transplant capabilities would be necessary [cite: Consensus Guideline for Managing Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hepatotoxicity, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf].*   If no improvement within 48-72 hours on high-dose corticosteroids, consider adding a second immunosuppressive agent such as mycophenolate mofetil [cite: Consensus Guideline for Managing Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hepatotoxicity, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf].\n\n    **Synthesis & Recommendation:** Based on the local guidelines, particularly the \"Tumor Response-Oriented Management\" table, the most appropriate immediate management is to permanently discontinue ICI therapy, admit the patient to the hospital for immediate management, start high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day), and obtain urgent hepatology consultation. This aligns with the severity of the patient's presentation.\n</LOCAL_CONVERGENT>\n\n<GAP_ANALYSIS>\n    -   **Concordance**: Both EASL guidelines and the \"Tumor Response-Oriented Management\" section of the local guidelines agree on several critical points for this patient's severe presentation:\n        1.  Immediate and permanent discontinuation of immunotherapy.\n        2.  Urgent hospital admission for close monitoring.\n        3.  Immediate initiation of high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day).\n        4.  The need for urgent hepatology consultation.\n        5.  The importance of monitoring liver parameters and INR.\n\n    -   **Divergence**: A significant divergence exists within the local guidelines themselves. The \"Consensus Guideline for Managing Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hepatotoxicity\" (Local Guideline Table 1) defines Grade 3 less stringently for hospitalization (only if INR >1.5 or encephalopathy) and delays corticosteroid initiation (after 5-7 days of observation if no improvement). This contrasts sharply with the EASL guidelines and the \"Tumor Response-Oriented Management\" (Local Guideline Table 2), both of which advocate for immediate hospitalization and corticosteroids for severe hepatotoxicity with jaundice. The patient's ALT (20.5x ULN) and TBL (3.75x ULN) placehim at the higher end of severity, making the more aggressive approach of EASL and Local Guideline Table 2 more fitting.\n\n    -   **Gaps & Alternatives**:\n        *   EASL explicitly recommends a liver biopsy in Grade 3/4 cases to exclude metastatic progression and assess damage pattern/severity, especially if no response to treatment [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. Local guidelines mention considering a liverbiopsy to rule out other causes if the clinical picture is atypical or if refractory to treatment, but not as an immediate first step for all severe cases.\n        *   EASL also emphasizes a comprehensive workup to exclude alternative causes of liver injury (viral, biliary, etc.) concurrently with treatment initiation [cite: EASL ClinicalPractice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Laboratory Workup for Excluding Alternative Causes, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. While implied in local guidelines, EASL provides more detail on this.\n        *   Local guidelines include sections on \"EarlyIntervention Strategies\" and \"Steroid-Sparing Approaches\" for Grade 2 hepatotoxicity, which are not directly applicable here but represent alternative strategies for less severe cases.\n\n    -   **Resolution Strategy**: In cases of divergence, particularly when patient safety is paramount, the more conservative and aggressive approach (i.e., immediatehospitalization and corticosteroids for severe hepatotoxicity with jaundice) should be prioritized. Therefore, the recommendations from EASL and the \"Tumor Response-Oriented Management\" section of the local guidelines should take precedence over the less aggressive stance of the other local guideline table for this patient's severe presentation. A multidisciplinary team involvinghepatologists and oncologists is crucial for decision-making, as recommended by EASL [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Liver Injury Associated with Immunotherapy for Cancer, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n</GAP_ANALYSIS>\n\n<RISK_ANALYSIS>\n    For the recommended management strategy (immediate discontinuation of immunotherapy, hospitalization, and high-dose corticosteroids), several risks and considerations exist:\n    1.  **Risk of Immunosuppression:** High-dose corticosteroids carry significant side effects, including increased risk of infection,hyperglycemia, hypertension, and psychiatric effects. This is particularly relevant for an oncology patient who may already be immunocompromised or have comorbidities.\n    2.  **Impact on Cancer Treatment:** Discontinuing immunotherapy, especially permanently, carries the risk of cancer progression. This is a critical trade-off that requires careful discussion withthe patient and the oncology team. The local guideline \"Tumor Response-Oriented Management\" acknowledges this by aiming to maintain continuous anti-cancer therapy where possible, but for Grade 4, permanent discontinuation is recommended.\n    3.  **Steroid Refractoriness:** Some patients may not respond to corticosteroids.In such cases, EASL and local guidelines suggest adding a second immunosuppressive agent like mycophenolate mofetil, which introduces further immunosuppression and potential side effects [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1,https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\n    4.  **Diagnostic Uncertainty:** While irDILI is highly suspected, other causes of acute liver injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, metastatic progression) must be ruled out. Delay in diagnosis ofan alternative etiology could lead to inappropriate treatment and worse outcomes. A liver biopsy, though not always immediate, can help clarify the diagnosis and guide management, especially if there's no response to initial therapy.\n    5.  **Progression to Liver Failure:** Despite aggressive management, there is a risk of progression to acuteliver failure, especially given the high bilirubin and transaminases. Close monitoring of INR and signs of encephalopathy is critical.\n</RISK_ANALYSIS>\n\n</THINKING>\n\n<FINAL_ANSWER>\n    <short_answer>\n    The most appropriate immediate management strategy for this patient is to immediatelyand permanently discontinue the combination immunotherapy, admit the patient to the hospital for urgent management and daily monitoring of liver parameters (ALT, AST, TBL, INR), and promptly initiate high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day). Concurrently, a comprehensive workupto exclude alternative causes of acute liver injury should be performed, and urgent hepatology consultation is recommended.\n    </short_answer>\n\n    <detailed_answer>\n    This recommendation is based on the patient's severe liver injury, characterized by ALT 20.5x ULN, AST 18.75x ULN, and Total Bilirubin 3.75x ULN, along with symptomatic jaundice. Both EASL guidelines and the \"Tumor Response-Oriented Management\" section of the local guidelines classify this as severe (EASL Grade 3/4, Local Grade 4) immune-mediated hepatotoxicity requiringaggressive intervention.\n\n    The EASL guidelines explicitly state that for Grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated liver injury, immunotherapy must be discontinued, and hospital admission is indicated if TBL is ≥2.5 mg/dL (which the patient's 4.5 mg/dL meets). High-dose corticosteroids (1–2 mg/kg/day) should be initiated immediately [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table 5. Management of Immune-Mediated Liver Injury, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. This is furthersupported by the local guideline's \"Tumor Response-Oriented Management\" table, which, for Grade 4 (ALT >20x ULN or ALT >3x ULN with TBL >2.0 mg/dL and symptoms), mandates permanent discontinuation of ICI, hospital admission, and immediate high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone [cite: Tumor Response-Oriented Management of Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs), p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/local_guideline.pdf].\n\n    While initiating treatment, a thorough diagnostic workup to exclude other causes of liver injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction) is crucial, as emphasized by EASL [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Laboratory Workup for Excluding Alternative Causes, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. Close daily monitoring of liver functiontests and INR is essential to assess response to treatment and detect any progression towards liver failure. If there is no response to corticosteroids within 2–3 days, the addition of a second immunosuppressive agent like mycophenolate mofetil should be considered [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Table5.
